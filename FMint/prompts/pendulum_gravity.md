$\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{g}{l}\sin(x) - b\frac{dx}{dt}$
The equation $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{g}{l}\sin(x) - b\frac{dx}{dt}$ describes the motion of a damped pendulum.
$x$ is the angular displacement, $g$ is the gravitational acceleration, $l$ is the pendulum length, and $b$ is the damping coefficient, which accounts for energy loss due to friction or air resistance.
This second-order differential equation models a real-world pendulum that experiences both gravitational force and damping. 
The term $-\frac{g}{l}\sin(x)$ represents the restoring force due to gravity, while $ - b\frac{dx}{dt}$ accounts for energy loss through friction or drag, which causes the oscillations to gradually decay over time.
If the damping coefficient $b = 0$, the equation simplifies to the undamped pendulum, $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{g}{l}\sin(x)$, which describes simple harmonic motion for small angles ($x$) where $\sin(x) \approx x$. In this case, the pendulum would oscillate indefinitely without energy loss.
The damping term $- b\frac{dx}{dt}$ represents a frictional force proportional to the pendulum’s velocity. This force dissipates energy, causing the amplitude of the oscillations to gradually decrease until the pendulum eventually comes to rest.  $b$ controls the rate of this energy loss.
The term $-\frac{g}{l}\sin(x)$ is the gravitational restoring force acting on the pendulum, which tries to pull it back to the equilibrium position (vertical). 
For small displacements, this behaves like a linear spring force.
For small oscillations, where $\sin(x) \approx x$, the equation reduces to $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = -\frac{g}{l}x - b\frac{dx}{dt}$, which represents a damped harmonic oscillator. This approximation is valid when the angle of displacement is small.
Depending on the value of the damping coefficient $b$ the pendulum’s motion can be either periodic (if $b$ is small) or aperiodic (if $b$ is large). 
In the case of large damping, the pendulum does not oscillate but instead slowly returns to equilibrium without completing a full swing.
Underdamped: If $b$ is small, the pendulum oscillates, but the amplitude decreases over time.
Critically damped: If $b$ is at a specific critical value, the pendulum returns to equilibrium in the shortest possible time without oscillating.
Overdamped: If $b$ is large, the pendulum slowly returns to equilibrium without oscillating.
The damping term in the equation leads to energy dissipation, meaning that the system loses mechanical energy over time. 
Initially, the pendulum has both kinetic and potential energy, but as it swings, friction (or air resistance) gradually converts this energy into heat, causing the pendulum to slow down.
Since the equation includes the $\sin(x)$ term, it is a nonlinear differential equation. This makes the behavior more complex than a simple harmonic oscillator, particularly for larger angles of oscillation. 
Nonlinear systems like this exhibit richer and more varied behaviors, including chaotic motion in extreme cases.
This equation is used to model real-world pendulums, such as those found in clocks, playground swings, and metronomes, where both gravitational forces and damping due to air resistance or friction need to be considered.
For larger angles, the $\sin(x)$ term dominates, and the pendulum behaves in a nonlinear fashion, deviating from the simple harmonic approximation. The restoring force no longer follows Hooke’s Law, and the period of oscillation becomes dependent on the amplitude.
In phase space, the damped pendulum’s motion can be visualized using trajectories in a 2D plot of position $x$ vs. velocity $\frac{dx}{dt}$. 
Over time, the system’s trajectory spirals toward the origin (equilibrium point), indicating the gradual loss of energy due to damping.
If an external periodic driving force is added to the system (not in the current equation), the damped pendulum can exhibit chaotic behavior. This happens when the damping, driving, and restoring forces interact in a complex way, leading to unpredictable and sensitive behavior to initial conditions.
The damped pendulum equation applies to mechanical systems where oscillations are damped due to friction or resistance. For example, it describes the motion of a mass-spring system where the spring provides the restoring force and the damper dissipates energy.
In engineering, achieving critical damping is often a goal in systems like car suspension, where it is desirable for the system to return to equilibrium quickly without oscillating. The same principle applies to the critically damped pendulum, which reaches rest as quickly as possible without oscillation.
Many natural systems, such as the motion of trees swaying in the wind or buildings during earthquakes, can be modeled as damped oscillators with nonlinear restoring forces.
The damped pendulum equation serves as a simplified version of these more complex systems.
The damping term $- b\frac{dx}{dt}$ causes the amplitude of oscillations to decay over time. For small damping, the amplitude decreases exponentially, while for larger damping, the pendulum takes longer to return to equilibrium.
In oscillatory systems, the damped pendulum equation illustrates how energy is transferred between kinetic and potential energy while simultaneously being lost due to damping. This concept applies to many systems where energy conversion and dissipation occur, such as electrical circuits with resistors and capacitors.
