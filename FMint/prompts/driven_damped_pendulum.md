$ \frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2} + b \frac{d \theta}{dt} + c \sin(\theta) = A \cos(\omega t) $
This equation models a driven damped pendulum, where $\theta$ is the angular displacement, $b$ is the damping coefficient, $c$ relates to the gravitational restoring force, and $A \cos(\omega t)$ is the driving force. 
The pendulum is subject to three forces: gravity, damping, and an external periodic driving force.
In this system, a pendulum experiences three types of forces: a restoring force ($c\sin(\theta)$)pulling it back to equilibrium, a damping force ($b \frac{d \theta}{dt}$) that reduces its energy, and a driving force ($A \cos(\omega t)$) that continuously supplies energy to keep the pendulum in motion.
The term $c\sin(\theta)$ represents the gravitational force acting on the pendulum, trying to return it to the equilibrium (vertical) position. 
For small angles, this behaves like a spring force, with $\sin(\theta) \approx \theta$ making the system linear for small oscillations.
The damping term $b \frac{d \theta}{dt}$ models the friction or air resistance that removes energy from the system. 
The larger $b$ is, the more energy the pendulum loses with each oscillation, reducing the amplitude of the swings unless the driving force compensates.
The driving term $A \cos(\omega t)$ represents an external periodic force acting on the pendulum, where $A$ is the amplitude of the driving force and $\omega$ is its angular frequency. This external force supplies energy to the pendulum, potentially leading to sustained or resonant oscillations.
When the driving frequency $\omega$ matches the natural frequency of the pendulum, resonance occurs. This leads to large amplitude oscillations, as the energy supplied by the driving force matches the system’s oscillatory nature, leading to efficient energy transfer.
The term $c\sin(\theta)$ introduces nonlinearity into the system. 
For large angles of oscillation, the system deviates from simple harmonic motion, and its behavior becomes more complex, especially when interacting with the driving force and damping.
Depending on the parameters $A, \omega, b$ and $c$, the driven damped pendulum can exhibit periodic motion (regular oscillations), quasi-periodic motion (oscillations with two incommensurate frequencies), or chaotic motion (highly sensitive and unpredictable behavior).
In phase space, the driven damped pendulum’s trajectory is plotted as angular position ($\theta$) versus angular velocity ($\frac{d \theta}{dt}$). 
For periodic motion, the system forms closed orbits, while chaotic motion is represented by a more erratic trajectory.
The driving force $A \cos(\omega t)$ continuously injects energy into the system, while the damping term $b \frac{d \theta}{dt}$ removes energy. 
If forces balance, the system can reach a steady-state oscillation, where the energy added by the driving force compensates for the energy lost to damping.
When $A = 0$, the equation reduces to a damped pendulum equation, where the pendulum eventually comes to rest due to the damping force. 
The driving term is essential to keep the pendulum moving indefinitely by supplying energy.
This system can exhibit parametric resonance when the external driving frequency $\omega$ is tuned to twice the natural frequency of the pendulum. This leads to increased amplitude of oscillations, even if the driving force amplitude $A$ is relatively small.
Small angle approximation: For small $\sin(\theta) \approx \theta$, and the system behaves like a driven harmonic oscillator with linear behavior.
Large angles: For larger $\theta$, the nonlinearity of $\sin(\theta)$ dominates, and the system can exhibit more complex or chaotic behavior, especially with strong driving forces.
In some parameter regimes, the pendulum’s motion can synchronize with the external driving force. This is known as frequency locking, where the pendulum oscillates at a frequency related to the driving frequency.
For certain combinations of parameters, the driven damped pendulum can exhibit chaotic behavior. This means that small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different long-term behavior, making the system unpredictable over long time scales.
In pendulum clocks, an external driving force (such as an escapement mechanism) compensates for the energy lost to damping. The equation models this system, where the goal is to maintain periodic motion over time despite energy loss.
This equation models mechanical systems subject to periodic forcing, such as a car suspension system driven by uneven road surfaces or a swing pushed periodically. 
The driving force keeps the system oscillating, while damping and restoring forces control the motion.
In phase-locked systems, such as coupled oscillators, the driven damped pendulum can demonstrate entrainment, where the pendulum locks onto the driving frequency. This concept is widely used in engineering systems like synchronization of electrical circuits.
The stability of the driven damped pendulum depends on the balance between damping, restoring forces, and driving forces. 
Linear stability analysis can be used to study how small perturbations evolve over time, and whether the system returns to its original motion or deviates.
